INTRODUCTION

In 2014, Fresh-Mart navigated a competitive grocery landscape with strong regional presence, loyal customers, and standout products. This dashboard dives deep into that performance, providing a holistic view of the company’s operations, from top-selling products to customer transactions and sales by region.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project was to analyze the sales performance of Fresh-Mart Grocery Store for the year 2014, with the goal of uncovering key insights related to product demand, regional and city-level performance, customer value, and sales team contributions. By transforming raw transactional data into an interactive dashboard, the aim was to support data-driven decision-making, identify growth opportunities, and provide strategic recommendations that enhance business operations and profitability.

KEY INSIGHTS

🏢 Company D was our top customer, contributing over $67,000 alone. That insight helped me understand the importance of high-value accounts.

🧍 Nancy Freehafer, with $104,000 in sales, was the best-performing salesperson — proof that individual performance can drive company success.

🧃 Beverages dominated product sales with over $110,000, signaling a strong, possibly replenishment-driven demand.

🗺️ Regionally, the North led the market, accounting for 32% of total sales. It became clear where the company should strengthen and where to expand.

📦 Cities like Chicago and Miami topped shipping volumes, and New York brought in the highest revenue — reinforcing the need to focus on high-density markets.

📆 December stood out as the best month, with over $66,000 in sales. I began to recognize the power of seasonality in retail analytics.

RECOMMENDATIONS

•	Prioritize High-Value Clients: Strengthen relationships with top customers like Company D through loyalty programs or exclusive deals.

•	Focus Sales Resources Strategically: Leverage high-performing salespeople like Nancy to mentor others or lead key accounts.

•	Expand in Western & Southern Regions: These areas show lower revenue and may be untapped markets.

•	Promote Beverages but Diversify Offerings: Beverages are strong, but categories like sauces and dairy have potential — targeted marketing could boost them.

•	Maximize Seasonal Highs: Use December’s spike as a baseline for future promotional planning. Consider replicating holiday bundles or early-bird offers.

•	Upsell Small Transaction Customers: A large share of revenue comes from smaller transactions, use personalized recommendations or bundled discounts to increase spend per visit.
 
CONCLUSION

Analyzing Fresh-Mart’s 2014 performance was more than a technical task; it was a real-world challenge in making sense of messy data, transforming it into insight, and telling a story that drives business understanding.

From identifying New York as the top revenue city to highlighting beverages as the highest-performing product category, and spotlighting December as the most lucrative month, this analysis unearthed patterns that matter. Sales leaderboards, regional contributions, and customer rankings further reveal where Fresh-Mart thrived and where opportunities lie.
